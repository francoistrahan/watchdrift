# Analysis

- Drift stats: migrate to statsmodel to force intercept at 0
- Graph Average drift over time

- Stats output needs to be properly orderred and needs better column names
- Legend colors don't match between graphs
- Superposed graph needs a better/cleaner representation; at minima, some radial graduations.
